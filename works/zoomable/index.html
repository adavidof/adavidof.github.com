	<h1>William Shakespeare</h1>
	<div class="description">
		<p>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</p>
		<p>Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer</p>
		<p>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,</p>
		<p>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,</p>
		<p>And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;</p>
		<p>No more; and by a sleep to say we end</p>
		<p>The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks</p>
		<p>That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation</p>
		<p>Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;</p>
		<p>To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;</p>
		<p>For in that sleep of death what dreams may come</p>
		<p>When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,</p>
		<p>Must give us pause: there's the respect</p>
		<p>That makes calamity of so long life;</p>
		<p>For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,</p>
		<p>The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,</p>
		<p>The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,</p>
		<p>The insolence of office and the spurns</p>
		<p>That patient merit of the unworthy takes,</p>
		<p>When he himself might his quietus make</p>
		<p>With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,</p>
		<p>To grunt and sweat under a weary life,</p>
		<p>But that the dread of something after death,</p>
		<p>The undiscover'd country from whose bourn</p>
		<p>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</p>
		<p>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</p>
		<p>Than fly to others that we know not of?</p>
		<p>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</p>
		<p>And thus the native hue of resolution</p>
		<p>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,</p>
		<p>And enterprises of great pith and moment</p>
		<p>With this regard their currents turn awry,</p>
		<p>And lose the name of action.-Soft you now!</p>
		<p>The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons</p>
		<p>Be all my sins remember'd.</p>
