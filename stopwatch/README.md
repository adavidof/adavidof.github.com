
StopWatch
=================== 
-----
We need to create a stopwatch widget with Native JS and Bootstrap framework.
Specification:
------------- 
> - Cross-browser: Opera, Firefox, Chrome and IE 9.

> - The "Start", "Stop"(the same button), "Lap", "Reset" buttons are we need.

> - Stopwatch has millisecond precision.

> - When stopwatch is running, time is displayed in hh: mm: ss: ms.

> - Clicking on the "Stop" button stops the progress of a stopwatch.

> - The "Lap" adds the current value of the stopwatch in the results list.

> - The elements of the result list can be deleted individually.

> - "Reset" button stops the stopwatch, if he runs, resets the value to zero, removes all the results, if any has.

> - Button "Lap" works the same way for the stopped and the stopwatch is running.

> - Keyboard control (tested to work in different keyboard layout - russian or english): s - start / stop, l - lap, r - reset.

> - If the page has several stopwatches, with keyboard we control one of the stopwatches which a mouse was leave last time.
